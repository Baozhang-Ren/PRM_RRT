# PRM_RRT
Sampling-based Motion Planning Using PRM and RRT

Computed a collision-free path for a rigid body (a piano) among static obstacles (a room) by implementing the Probabilistic Roadmap Method (PRM) as well as its asymptotically optimal variant
(PRMâˆ—).

Computed feasible controls for a car-like vehicle that result in a collision-free trajectory in a maze-like environment by implementing the Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) algorithm. The program passed sampled linear and angular velocities of the rigid body and execution time to a car-like vehicle to simulate tree nodes in Gazebo. Then used A* to find the shortest path in the tree to create a collision-free trajectory.
